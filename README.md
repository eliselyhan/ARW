# Model Assessment and Selection under Temporal Distribution Shift

Paper: [Model Assessment and Selection under Temporal Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08672), to appear in ICML 2024.

The file <a href="./code-synthetic-data/ARW.py">`ARW.py`</a> provides Python implementations of Adaptive Rolling Window (ARW) methods for model assessment and selection.

1. Function `ARWME`: Adaptive Rolling Window for Mean Estimation (Algorithm 1 in the paper).
  
2. Function `tournament_selection`: Single-Elimination Tournament for Model Selection (Algorithm 3 in the paper).
